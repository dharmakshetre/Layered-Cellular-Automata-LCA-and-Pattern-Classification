# Layered-Cellular-Automata-LCA-and-Pattern-Classification

File 1 - Pictorial.java 
>In this program, we have displayed the change in the dynamics, when rule g is applied.

File 2 - List_Multiple_Convergence.java 
>This program finds the Single and Multiple Attractors for different CA Size(n, where n is ranging from 4 to 11) and for each n, different block sizes(1 to n-1).

File 3 - Multiple_Attractor.java
>In this program, We use the list of multiple convergent LCAs, obtained from "List_Multiple_Convergence.java". And find out ruleset which shows multiple convergence for all CA Size(n, where n is ranging from 4 to 11) and for each n, different block sizes(1 to n-1), we use that ruleset for pattern classification.

File 4 - Training_Classifier.java 
>In this program, we performed training on two datasets P1 and P2, to create a Two-Class Pattern Classifier.

File 5 - Testing_Classifier.java
>In this program, we performed testing on two new datasets P1 and P2, to find LCA, which shows maximum efficiency(accuracy).
